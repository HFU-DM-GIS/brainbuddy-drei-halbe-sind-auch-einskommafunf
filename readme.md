# Memory game
## Introduction
This is a simple memory game project, and this README will guide you on how to set it up and make it functional. 
The game utilizes images from Unsplash, and to fetch these images, you need to obtain a free API key from [unsplash.com](https://unsplash.com/developers).

## Getting Started
To get started with the memory game, follow these steps:

1. Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine.

2. Acquire Unsplash API Key
Visit unsplash.com and sign up for a free account. Once logged in, create a new application to generate an API key.

3. Insert API Key in JavaScript File
Open the project directory and navigate to the js folder. Inside this folder, create a new file named apikey.js. In this file, add the following code:

`const apikey = "[YOUR_API_KEY]";`

Replace `[YOUR_API_KEY]` with the API key you obtained from Unsplash.


## Usage
Now that you have set up the project with your API key, you can run the game by opening the HTML file in a web browser. The game will use the Unsplash API to fetch images for the memory cards.

Enjoy playing our memory game!
